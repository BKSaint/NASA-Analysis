# July 1995 NASA Log Analysis

Hello Mr. Forlenza, im glad that you chosen this specific file for us to analyze as it depicts something very interesting. 



## *Data Traffic* 

![Graph #1](/Figure_1.png)

In this diagram, it illustrates a huge spike in the data on July 13th, meaning there was a lot of traffic on that specific day. 

## *Shuttle Missions*
![Graph #2](/Figure_3.png)

After some research, i found that there was actually a shuttle launch scheduled on this day! To further prove this, i ran a test to see which files was being taken from the website the most on this day...

## *Most Frequent Files*
![Graph #3](/Figure_2.png)

This graph shows the top 5 frequent files the log saved excluding "NASAlogo-small.gif", which i assumed to be a gif that plays while loading the website, and the 5th most frequent has something to do with the liftoff of the shuttle!  

This shows that the website creates the most traffic when something big happens similar to their shuttle liftoff in July during NASA's schedule.
